### What is ServiceWorker?

ServiceWorker is a background worker, it gives us a JavaScript context to add features such as push messaging, background sync, geofencing and network control.

### Getting Started

To begin, you need to register for a ServiceWorker from your page:

```javascript
if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/worker.js').then(function(reg) {
    console.log('ðŸ˜ƒ', reg);
  }, function(err) {
    console.log('ðŸ˜­', err);
  });
}
```

As you can see, `.register` take a URL for your worker script and returns a promise. The ServiceWorker script must be on the same origin as your page.
